# Economic benefits
### Time to save money and dress sharply

![bg right:30%](images/03-business_man_graffiti.jpg)

<!--
- It's all bout' the money, it's all bout the dumdudmudumdudm.

- Unfortuneatly this is what people other than nerds general care about.  

- Useful knowledge to understand how we got here.

- Important for you to make friends/get promoted/earn a decent salary at most places.

Segue: Let's start with the simple stuff - HW.

## Less hardware means...
- Less data center space
- Less supporting infrastructure
- Less electricity and cooling
- Less things that can break

![bg right:30%](images/03-fly_on_knife.jpg)

<!--
- Data center space is expensive, as it needs to be secure, climate controlled and somewhat clean.

- Servers need a lot of supporting infrastructure such as network switches, UPSes and (especially)
back in the days KVMs (Keyboard-Video-Mouse, yikes). It all cost money and take space.

- These days it should not come as a surprise to anyone, but electricity is expensive. Cooling also
requires a lot of energy (in general).

- Lots of HW means that many things must be maintained and that can break - not just servers but
also supporting infrastructure. Humans need to fix/order/replace these, humans are expensive and
annoying: you need to find them, give em money and keep them happy.

Segue: Another thing to consider is that we barely use the computers that we've bought.

## _Studies_ show _average_ data center CPU utilization at 6-30%

![bg right:30%](images/03-oil_refinery.jpg)

<!--
- There are studies out there made by various actors: all of them show very low utilization.

- These have been produced with more or less effort: many contains circular references.

- Others, such as those published by Google and Alibaba are not likely not very representative of
average enterprise environments.

- Match instructors anecdotal observations.

- We can like fit these computing needs on a few hypervisors instead.

## Resource sharing means...
- Shared margins for resource utilization
- Easier capacity planning
- Cost savings through use of more efficient/powerful hardware

![bg right:30%](images/03-tumbler.jpg)

<!--
- We also don't need to think so much about margins. We can always vertically scale guests, in some
cases even without shutting down the instance: Linux supports hot swapping of CPUs and similar.

- Same goes for capacity planning, don't need to spend so much effort for every system.

- In general, more powerful HW is more cost efficient from a power and/or space perspective. It
would probably hard to motivate investment in such fancy HW without knowing if it would be used.

# Technical interlude

<!--
Let's take a deep breath: in order to explain further economic benefits we need to understand the
underlying technology a bit better. Let's talk about guest migration.
-->

## Guest migration
Move VM from one hypervisor to another.

### Offline
Guest is shutdown before migration and started afterwards.

### Online
Guest remains running and is almost seamlessly migrated between hypervisors.

![bg right:30%](images/03-crystal_wave.jpg)

<!--
- In a clustered environment we can move guests between hypervisors

- Some solutions support migrating state (disk, memory, CPU registers, etc) and through slight of
hand make the guest run seamlessly on the other host. Some don't: offline VS online.

- While not a strict requirement, some type of shared storage for VM disks/file systems is required

- Not trivial, but we'll cover the implementation details later in the course.

Migration of VMs, especially live, enables service of hypervisors during office hours.  
  
If hardware breaks, just start up the VM on another host.  
  
**Humans are likely the biggest cost.**

![bg right:30%](images/03-kolibri.jpg)

<!--
- Being able to do maintenance without screaming users is huge.

- Handling HW breakage seams trivial, not so much back in the days when Windows was tightly coupled
with the hardware it was installed on. Still not trivial - both due to actual and license problems

- Legacy systems can survive long past their HWs due date. Companies love this, sysadmins not so
much.

- Deserves repeating: Human labor is expensive and something most organisations try to avoid.

Deploying software stacks on hardware requires time-consuming planning, procurement and setup.  
  
Automation and self-service features cuts time required for meetings and hand-overs.  
  
**Virtualisation makes organisations faster.**

![bg right:30%](images/03-frosty_lion.jpg)

<!--
- Costs needed to anticipated in detail. The requirement to pay a lot up front for new systems was
a huge barrier for startups/small players.

- Buying HW, finding space in a rack and making somewhat put it up takes a lot of effort.

- Lead times for hardware is really long these days and the supply chain is unpredictable.

- If we can remove humans we can start to automate things. Time consuming (expensive) to move tasks
between developers and HW team, lot's of room for errors and miscommunication.

- We wouldn't have devops the way it is today without virtualisation.

Virtualisation provides a (more or less) predictable execution environment.  
  
Testing, installation and support of complex software stacks is expensive.  
  
**Software vendors love virtual appliances.**

![bg right:30%](images/03-rusted_cards.jpg)

<!--
- Selling software that other parties are suppose to install, manage and/or maintain is a real
mess and quite annoying.

- You need to take a lot of variables into question: OS version, hardware/drivers, faulty setup.

- Before the problem used to be solved by shipping pizza boxes to customers, but that's also meh.

- Virtual appliances can be delivered preconfigured in a somewhat predictable environment, only
exposing limited configuration options that the customers can screw up.
