# Exercise: Pitch to Greta
Describe environmental benefits of using virtualisation based on what you've learned so far.  
  
Feel free to discuss with others, but every participant should submit their own pitch.

- Many of the properties provided by virtualisation showed both benefits for cost-savings and
reliability. Same goes for it's environmental benefits.

- There are also other things that are relevant, put some effort into thinking about it.

# Less HW means less waste
- Doesn't just apply to servers, but supporting equipment and infrastructure as well 
- Smaller margins, instances can be scaled
- Bigger/more powerful systems makes sense
- _Studies_ show _average_ data center CPU utilization at 6-30%

Basically the same as for saving money on HW.

# Less HW means less energy
- Doesn't just apply to servers, but supporting equipment and infrastructure as well 
- Bigger/more powerful systems are (usually) more energy efficient
- Migration enables power cycling of servers based on utilization

- Basically the same as for saving money on HW.

- Besides the peaks, most hypervisors could likely be shutdown to electricity/produce less heat.
For this to be reasonable, live migration and/or batch workloads are likely needed.
