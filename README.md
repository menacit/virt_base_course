# Virtualisation course
**Freely available and collaboratively developed**

## Introduction
This repository contains the source material for Menacit's virtualisation course.
It is designed to be instructor lead and collaboratively improved by the community.  
  
The course covers the pros and cons of virtualisation, differences between HW-level and OS-level
virtualisation, development tools such as "Vagrant" and "Docker", VDI and similar topics.  
  
A rendered version of all the presentations can seen [here](https://t.menacit.se/virt_course).  
  
**The course is actively being developed and is currently not in a fully usable state -
feedback and contributions are warmly welcomed!**


## How to contribute
Besides using Github issues to suggest changes, improvements or request clarifications, feel free
to fork the repository and submit a pull request.  

The course relies on [scenskrack](https://github.com/Doctor-love/scenskrack) to generate PDF/HTML
versions of the slides and bundle things into ZIP files. Remember to include yourself in the author
section and add attribution for any images used in slides. All content included should be available
under an OSI approved [Creative Commons license](https://github.com/Doctor-love/scenskrack) (BY,
BY-SA or CC0). For tracking of images and other large assets, the
[Git LFS extension](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is used.  
  
PRs containing photos of cats and/or dogs will be rejected - there are already to many of them on
the Internet! ;-)
