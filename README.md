# Virtualisation course

## Introduction
This repository contains the source material for Menacit's introductory virtualisation course.
It is designed to be instructor-led and collaboratively improved by the students/community.  
  
A rendered version of all the presentations can be previewed [here](https://t.menacit.se/virt).  

In addition to the public material, freely available resources such as examination tests exist to
aid teachers of the course. For access, please get in touch!
  
**The course is actively being developed and is currently not in a fully usable state -
feedback and contributions are warmly welcomed!**


## How to contribute
Besides using Github issues to suggest changes, improvements or request clarifications, feel free
to fork the repository and submit a pull request.  

The course relies on [scenskrack](https://github.com/doctor-love/scenskrack) to generate PDF/HTML
versions of the slides and bundle things into ZIP files. Remember to include yourself in the author
section and add attribution for any images used in slides. All content included should be available
under an OSI approved [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/)
(BY, BY-SA or CC0). For tracking of images and other large assets, the
[Git LFS extension](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is used.  
  
PRs containing photos of cats and/or dogs will be rejected - there are already to many of them on
the Internet! ;-)
