# Virtualisation labs

<!--
- So far, we've been going through a lot of theory

- We're about to put that knowledge to the test

**Lab descriptions tell you what to do,
not exactly how you should do it.**  
  
**Your submissions should document
how you solved the problem.**

<!--
- Labs will be based on different scenarios you may encounter in real life

- Just like in real life, no one will tell you exactly how to do it. Then the job should be
replaced by a shell script

- No one knows every on-top of their head, feel free to Google, discuss with class mates, look
through old slides and ask for support

- Let me know how you approached the challenge and why you chose the solution steps you did
